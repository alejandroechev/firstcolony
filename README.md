This repository contains different version of the game First Colony, a game design to teach electrostatics concepts,
implemented and tested in schools as a research project at Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile.

The code includes two versions of the game, designed for two platforms: an augmented reality one and a multi-mice one. Both games
are designed to be deployed in a classroom setting, where the teacher runs the server of the game and controls the advancemente of the students
through the game.
